      <p>2016 will mark the beginning of a new chapter in T-Bone’s trend setting extensive career. After nearly two decades of music, three Grammy nominations, five Dove Awards, multiple films, including the recently released “I’m In Love With A Church Girl” and two nationwide television shows “Real Videos” (TBN) and TX10 (JCTV), T-Bone is ready to take the music industry by storm once again with the release of his newest project “RETURN OF THE BIONIC MAN”. Comparing himself to astronaut Steve Austin (The Bionic Man from the 70’s hit TV show) who was nearly killed after a life ending crash, only to be rebuilt and made better, stronger and faster with super bionic powers, T-Bone says his own transformation has been nearly as drastic.</p>
      <p>For starters, the rapper/actor’s appearance has drastically changed. T-Bone lost over 100 pounds since his last album and has been working tirelessly in the gym for the past several years to get himself up to par. “I felt like I needed to take a change in my life, starting with the way I ate, guarding my temple. I knew my health was deteriorating and as a role model I feel it is my responsibility to be a good example to the people around the world that listen to my music”. His sound has also changed since his last recording. He has now added singing to his arsenal of musical talents. “After years of making Hip-Hop/Rap records, I felt like I wanted to do something new, fresh, and innovative” says T-Bone. “I’ve always been influenced from music around the world as well as different cultures and wanted to make music that would reach beyond just the normal Rap/Hip-Hop market; hence “The Bionic Man” was created</p>
      <p>“This album will feature a lot of singing, something my fans have only heard bits and pieces of on previous albums, intergraded with catchy and melodic hooks. It will definitely have an eclectic sound”. T-Bone has hooked up with the super production team “The Sterotypes” and Tim “Boski” Bullock to help put together this new sound. The Sterotypes known for producing multi platinum selling artists such as Justin Bieber, Ne-Yo, Bruno Mars, Far East Movement, Mary J. Blige, P-Diddy, Chris Brown and Pitbull just to name a few. “Boski” has worked with everyone from Timberland, Rhianna, Big Sean and Young Jezzy to name a few.</p>
      <p>Aside from his music, T-Bone has focused on taking his acting career to the next level. “After starring in The Fighting Temptations alongside Beyonce Knowles and Cuba Gooding Jr., I fell in love with the art of acting”, says the pioneering artist. “I wanted to start a real career in acting and God just somehow always opens the door”. T-Bone is starring in two new movies. In the first film “The Rally”, T-Bone co-stars alongside world-renowned religious evangelist Kenneth Copeland. In the film,</p>
      <p>T-Bone (Sharka) plays a drug lord who has control of the city and whom people fear until a young preacher who is not willing to back down regardless of what the cost may be challenges him. The movie was filmed in Riverside, CA earlier this year.</p>
